About
node-nude is a node.js adaptation of Patrick Wied's nude.js implementation (http://github.com/pa7/node.js). The initial goal is to seperate the dependance on the DOM by leveraging node-canvas directly which would provide server-side nudity scanning.

Demo
The test images from nude.js have been included in order to show the same detection results between node-nude and nude.js
$sudo apt-get update
$sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev libjpeg8-dev libpango1.0-dev libgif-dev build-essential g++ libjpeg-dev
$npm install canvas
npm install
node tests/test.nude.js (ANNNNND wait a long time...it's on my list of things to do....)
